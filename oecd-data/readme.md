Data: Indicators of gender equality in employment
Indicators are criteria or measures against which changes can be assessed (Imp-Act 2005). They may be pointers, facts, numbers, opinions or perceptions – used to signify changes in specific conditions or progress towards particular objectives URL:(https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=54734) Format: comma separated variable (csv)

Data: Average wages
Average wages are obtained by dividing the national-accounts-based total wage bill by the average number of employees in the total economy, which is then multiplied by the ratio of the average usual weekly hours per full-time employee to the average usually weekly hours for all employees. This indicator is measured in USD constant prices using 2016 base year and Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) for private consumption of the same year.

Data refer to full-time employees on the one hand and to self-employed on the other. URL:(https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/gender-wage-gap.htm) Format: comma separated variable (csv)

Data: Employment rate
Employment rates are defined as a measure of the extent to which available labour resources (people available to work) are being used. They are calculated as the ratio of the employed to the working age population. Employment rates are sensitive to the economic cycle, but in the longer term they are significantly affected by governments’ higher education and income support policies and by policies that facilitate employment of women and disadvantaged groups.

Data: Gross domestic product (GDP)
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports). While GDP is the single most important indicator to capture economic activity, it falls short of providing a suitable measure of people’s material well-being for which alternative indicators may be more appropriate URL:(https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm) Format: comma separated variable (csv)

Data: Population
Population is defined as all nationals present in, or temporarily absent from a country, and aliens permanently settled in a country. This indicator shows the number of people that usually live in an area. Growth rates are the annual changes in population resulting from births, deaths and net migration during the year.
